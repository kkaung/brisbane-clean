## Spring Cleaning Guide for the Brisbane

Spring has sprung on the Brisbane! As the days get longer and the sunshine beckons, it's natural to feel the urge to refresh your home. But the thought of tackling a massive spring clean can be daunting. Here at West Maid, we want to help!

This guide provides a room-by-room breakdown to make your spring cleaning a breeze. We'll also share some handy tips specific to the Brisbane climate, so you can enjoy a sparkling and healthy home all season long.

### Living Room:

- **Declutter and Donate:** Start by removing anything you no longer use or love. Donate unwanted items to charity shops.
- **Deep Clean Upholstery:** Remove dust mites and allergens with a professional steam clean.
- **Window Magic:** Capture those gorgeous Brisbane views with sparkling clean windows. Don't forget to remove any built-up dust from blinds or curtains.
- **Sunshine Freshness:** For a natural refresh, air out cushions and throws on a sunny day.

### Kitchen:

- **Appliance Attention:** Tackle greasy build-up on stovetops and ovens. Don't forget to clean underneath and behind appliances.
- **Fridge Rejuvenation:** Empty, wipe down shelves, and discard expired food. Consider lining shelves with washable mats for easier future cleaning.
- **Cabinet Care:** Wipe down cabinet doors and handles. Declutter pantries and organize spices.

### Bathroom Bliss:

- **Disinfect and Shine:** Deep clean showers, bathtubs, toilets, and sinks. Pay close attention to areas prone to mildew and mold growth, especially common in our humid Brisbane climate.
- **Sparkle Up Fixtures:** Polish chrome faucets and showerheads to a gleaming finish.
- **Towel Refresh:** Wash towels in hot water and replace any that are worn or stained.

### Bedrooms:

- **Mattress Magic:** Vacuum and flip your mattress. Consider a professional mattress cleaning for a deeper clean.
- **Bedding Refresh:** Wash all bedding, including pillows and comforters, in hot water.
- **Dust Busters:** Wipe down furniture, ceiling fans, and light fixtures. Pay attention to hard-to-reach areas where dust bunnies love to hide.

**Bonus Tip:** Embrace the Brisbane sunshine! Open windows and doors whenever possible to allow fresh air and natural light to circulate throughout your home.
